# Rust <3 mupdf

**Caution:** *This project is unfinished, doesn't free resources and
has dragons hiding everywhere.  Use it for fun, but don't expect it
to work!*

Let's try working with PDFs in Rust!

## Notes

- run `cargo test --lib -- --nocapture` to run the tests
- requires a relatively recent version of mupdf (tested with 1.7a)
